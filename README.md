<div align="start">

### Abstract  
The Student Performance Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model that estimates students' academic marks based on various factors such as gender, race, parental level of education, and writing and reading scores. The project utilizes a large dataset containing training and testing data to train and evaluate machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor. The primary objective is to create an accurate and robust predictive model that can assist educators and stakeholders in understanding the potential impact of different factors on student performance.

### Dataset:  
The project uses a comprehensive dataset that includes information about students' demographics, parental education levels, writing and reading scores, and final exam marks. The dataset is split into a training set, which is used to train the models, and a testing set, which is used to evaluate their performance.

### Conclusion:  
The Student Performance Prediction project demonstrates the potential of machine learning algorithms, specifically the Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor, in estimating students' marks based on various factors. The project contributes to the ongoing efforts to enhance education by providing a tool for educators to make informed decisions and allocate resources effectively.
